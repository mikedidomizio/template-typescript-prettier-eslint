# Quick starter template with Typescript/Prettier/ESLint/Vitest

This is a template to be used for a quick Javascript setup that includes

- Typescript
- Prettier/ESLint
- Vitest
- GitHub actions
- Proper build output with typedefs

The idea behind this was because I like to be able to quickly get a basic Javascript project up and running.

⚠️ Don't forget to update the repository package name, description, author, and license

Squashing all commits can be done with the following commands:

```shell
git reset --soft $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
git add -A
git commit --amend --reset-author -m "Initial commit"
```
